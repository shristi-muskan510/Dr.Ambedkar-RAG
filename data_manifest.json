The essay argues for moral transformation as the superior means of achieving social justice."

Ambedkar argues that while both traditions seek the removal of suffering and exploitation, their methods fundamentally diverge. Communism relies on violence and dictatorship, which destroy liberty and moral ends in the process of reform. Buddhism, by contrast, emphasizes moral force, justice, and democratic principles. Drawing on Buddhist dialogues and parables, Ambedkar demonstrates that durable social order cannot be sustained through coercion, but only through ethical training and voluntary moral discipline."

  "abstract": "In this section, Ambedkar critically examines the Communist claim that the State will eventually wither away under permanent dictatorship. He argues that coercion cannot sustain a social order once force is withdrawn and that moral and spiritual foundations are indispensable for long-term stability. Contrasting Communist hostility to religion with Buddhism’s ethical and worldly orientation, Ambedkar shows how the Buddha reconciled material prosperity with moral discipline. He concludes that while Communism may achieve equality, only the Buddhist path can harmonize equality with liberty and fraternity, making social reconstruction durable and humane."

Rejecting racial and purely religious explanations, Ambedkar argues that caste represents the parcelling of an originally homogeneous society. Through a critical review of prevailing definitions of caste, he demonstrates that endogamy—rather than occupation, race, or ritual purity—is the central mechanism governing caste formation, persistence, and expansion."

  "abstract": "In this section, Ambedkar advances his central thesis that endogamy is the defining essence of caste in India. Rejecting occupation, ritual purity, and food restrictions as secondary effects, he argues that caste arises from the deliberate superposition of endogamy upon an originally exogamous and culturally homogeneous society. Ambedkar then identifies the core practical problem of caste maintenance—the regulation of marriageable units—and shows how surplus men and women pose a structural threat to caste continuity. This analysis lays the groundwork for explaining the social controls developed to preserve caste boundaries."

  "abstract": "In this section, Ambedkar completes his scientific explanation of caste by identifying the concrete social mechanisms devised to preserve endogamy. He shows how surplus women and surplus men threaten caste continuity and how Hindu society developed gendered solutions—Sati, enforced widowhood, celibacy, and child marriage—to regulate marriageable units. Ambedkar argues that these practices were not moral ideals but functional instruments for maintaining caste boundaries. Customs long justified through religious philosophy are thus revealed as structural devices essential to the survival of the caste system."

He argues that customs such as Sati, enforced widowhood, and child marriage were functional means later idealized through philosophy. Defining caste as an enclosed class, he identifies the Brahmin class as the first group to institutionalize endogamy, with other castes adopting similar practices through social imitation rather than coercion or divine legislation. Ambedkar decisively rejects scriptural, law-giver, and great-man theories of caste, establishing caste as a socially evolved institution sustained by imitation, rationalization, and structural necessity rather than conscious design."

Rejecting occupational, evolutionary, and naturalistic theories, he argues that caste emerged when open social classes became endogamous through imitation of the Brahmin caste. Drawing on Gabriel Tarde’s laws of imitation, Ambedkar shows how prestige, proximity, and hierarchical influence led non-Brahmin classes to copy Brahmin social practices, including endogamy and associated customs. Caste formation is thus explained as a process of social emulation rather than divine command, natural evolution, or conscious coercion."

He emphasizes that caste exists only as a system of multiple interacting units and is inherently self-duplicating. Rejecting racial, occupational, and colour-based explanations, Ambedkar synthesizes his argument around cultural unity, endogamy, imitation, and exclusion. He concludes by positioning his theory as a scientific contribution—open to revision—aimed at redirecting caste studies toward objective, structural analysis rather than sentiment or scriptural justification."

He documents Gandhi’s refusal to employ Satyagraha or fasting against caste Hindus, even while Untouchables endured violence during temple-entry and water-rights movements. Ambedkar argues that social reform without political power had repeatedly failed and that Untouchables therefore required constitutional safeguards. He critically examines Gandhi’s opposition to separate political representation for Untouchables at the Round Table Conference and interprets the Poona Pact as a coerced compromise that ultimately weakened Dalit political autonomy."
